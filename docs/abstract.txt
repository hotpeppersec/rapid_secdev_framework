# Rapid SecDev Framework

This is a quick template using common open source tech that can be used to
get a prototype or project off the ground quickly. This framework was
created to allow us to spin up many Git repos for blue team security
projects. There is always a need for testing that works locally during
dev, as well as in the CI/CD pipeline. To the extent possible, developers
should be focused on creating & testing new features rather than trying to
get the dev environment running or making it mirror what's in production.
With this template repo, you can have a familiar framework to get your
new tool or automation up and running quickly.
